# Sharpe-ratio-calculator (Python Basics + NumPy & AI)

This project demonstrates how to calculate and interpret the Sharpe ratio, a key measure of risk-adjusted portfolio performance, using core Python concepts:
 - Variables
 - Loops
 - Functions
 - NumPy

## Formula
Sharpe = (Rp - Rf) / σp

Where
Rp = Annualized portfolio return
Rf = Risk-free rate (2% used by default)
σp = Portfolio volatility (standard deviation)

## Example
For a portfolio with an annualized return of 12%, volatility of 10%, and a 2% risk-free rate:
Sharpe = (0.12 - 0.02) / 0.10 = 1.00

## What I Practiced
• Writing reusable functions for return, volatility, and Sharpe ratio
• Using loops to process simulated return data
• Applying NumPy for vectorized financial math
• Strengthening Python fundamentals while learning portfolio analytics
